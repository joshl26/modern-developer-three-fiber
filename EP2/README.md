The Modern Developer - React Three Fiber Ep2 - Importing a 3D Avatar - PART 2

Welcome to the second video in our React Three Fiber tutorial series!

To recap: In the last video, we created a new React App and coded the basic scene for our 3D avatar. Which currently only includes a single test cube. We also included OrbitControls to be able to rotate our test cube in 3D space. 

In this episode we dive deeper into React Three Fiber, exploring the ability to import and animate 3D avatar files. So come along as we check this cool new tech in detail!
